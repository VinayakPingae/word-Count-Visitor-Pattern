Design an develop the following 2 visitors:
A visitor that reads an input file, input.txt, and populates a tree data structure with all the words in the file. Use the tree data structure that will maximize performance for the second visitor. Store the words in the tree using the insert criteria for that tree data structure.
A visitor that counts the number of words, number of unique words, and number of characters in the tree and stores it in a file named output.txt.
The words from the input file should be stored/inserted in the tree using the tree property. So, if you use a BST, then you need to check newWord < currentNodeWord, etc.
It is acceptable to use data structure(s) within each tree node to store information about that node's content. However, you cannot use a separate data structure to keep track of the entire tree's data.


This is the implementation of the use of Data Structures and performing word count with a finesse of Visitor pattern.
